# 3d-Tangle-Visualizer

only good for a few transactions, I think the check if the transaction is already there is a problem

-left click on a node for the tx at thetangle.org

-left click hold on a node to move it

change to a devnet zmq stream for a nicer tangle

run it with `node index.js` and open `localhost` in your browser

required: nodejs, express, socket.io, zmq, 3d-force-graph
